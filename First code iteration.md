To create a Python code demonstrating the Main Brain system described, I'll outline a simplified version, emphasizing on the core requirements such as units with communication abilities, history management, basic profiles (seeds), and inter-unit communication. The system will also incorporate interactions with a simulated GPT API, considering the constraints of this environment.

**Note:** An actual implementation connecting to the GPT API (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3) would require API tokens and managing API request limits, which are not directly included in this simulation. Instead, I'll simulate the GPT responses to focus on the architecture and interaction patterns.

### Preliminaries

For this setup, we'll create:

- A `Unit` class to represent each AI unit with conversation abilities.
- Simulation of GPT API responses based on unit's profile.
- A system to manage interactions and history.
- A simplified merging and decision process for unit responses.

### Python Implementation

```python
import collections
import random

# Mock GPT Response based on Unit's Profile
def mock_gpt_response(prompt, profile_seed):
    # This is a very simplified simulation of how a response might be generated.
    responses = {
        "analytical": "Analyzing the data, it's clear that...",
        "creative": "Imagine a world where...",
        "negative": "Unfortunately, that's not going to work because...",
        "positive": "Absolutely, that's a fantastic idea because..."
    }
    base_response = responses.get(profile_seed, "Let's think about this...")
    return f"{base_response} Based on '{prompt}', I think..."

class Unit:
    def __init__(self, profile_seed, memory_capacity):
        self.profile_seed = profile_seed
        self.history = collections.deque(maxlen=memory_capacity)
    
    def send_prompt(self, prompt):
        response = mock_gpt_response(prompt, self.profile_seed)
        # Add prompt and response to history
        self.history.append((prompt, response))
        return response

    def get_last_interaction(self):
        if self.history:
            return self.history[-1]
        return None, None
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Unit<Profile:{self.profile_seed}, History Size:{len(self.history)}>"

def main_interaction_cycle(units):
    initial_prompt = "What do you think about artificial intelligence?"
    for unit in units:
        response = unit.send_prompt(initial_prompt)
        print(f"{unit}: {response}")

    # Unit-to-unit interaction
    for i, unit in enumerate(units):
        _, last_response = unit.get_last_interaction()
        for other_unit in units[i+1:]:
            response = other_unit.send_prompt(last_response)
            print(f"Interaction between {unit} and {other_unit}: {response}")

# Creating Units
listener = Unit("analytical", 5)
middle_unit_1 = Unit("creative", 5)
middle_unit_2 = Unit("negative", 5)
final_decider = Unit("positive", 5)

# Initial Setup for Example
units = [listener, middle_unit_1, middle_unit_2, final_decider]

# Running the interaction cycle
main_interaction_cycle(units)
```

### Explanation

- The `Unit` class simulates a chat interaction with a "profile seed" determining its response style.
- The `mock_gpt_response` function simulates varied responses based on the profile seed and received prompt.
- The `main_interaction_cycle` demonstrates an interaction where each unit receives an initial prompt and then the units interact with each other based on the previous responses.
- History for each unit is managed within a bounded queue (`collections.deque`), respecting the memory capacity.

**Note:** This basic implementation aims to simulate the system behavior and can be extended to incorporate actual GPT API interactions, more sophisticated decision-making processes between units, and complex unit interaction patterns.
