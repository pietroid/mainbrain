To transition the function `mock_gpt_response` for actual GPT API use, we can modify the existing setup to include network requests to the GPT API. Assuming we're aiming to use OpenAI's GPT (for example, GPT-4), you'll need to sign up for access and obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).

Here's an upgraded version of the `Unit` class and a function for utilizing the API, which you can then integrate into the main interaction cycle. Remember, you'll need to substitute `"your_api_key_here"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

### Upgraded Implementation

Before running this, install the necessary package:

```bash
pip install openai
```

Here's how you can adapt the code to include real GPT API calls:

```python
import openai
import collections

# Set your OpenAI API key here
API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"

def gpt_response(prompt, profile_seed):
    """
    Function to fetch response from GPT based on prompt and profile_seed (a simplistic approach to influencing style).
    """
    openai.api_key = API_KEY
    
    # Adapt these parameters to influence the GPT's response based on the profile_seed
    temperature = 0.7 if profile_seed == "creative" else 0.5
    response_length = 100
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003", # You mentioned an interest in GPT-4. Change the engine as needed.
        prompt=prompt,
        temperature=temperature,
        max_tokens=response_length,
        top_p=1.0,
        frequency_penalty=0.0,
        presence_penalty=0.0
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

class Unit:
    def __init__(self, profile_seed, memory_capacity):
        self.profile_seed = profile_seed
        self.history = collections.deque(maxlen=memory_capacity)
    
    def send_prompt(self, prompt):
        response = gpt_response(prompt, self.profile_seed)
        # Add prompt and response to history
        self.history.append((prompt, response))
        return response

    def get_last_interaction(self):
        if self.history:
            return self.history[-1]
        return None, None
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Unit<Profile:{self.profile_seed}, History Size:{len(self.history)}>"
```

### Usage and Considerations

- **API Key Protection:** Ensure your API key is securely stored and not hard-coded into your scripts when deploying your application.
- **Cost Management:** Keep in mind that calling the OpenAI API is not free after surpassing the free tier. Plan your usage accordingly.
- **Response style customization:** The function `gpt_response()` currently uses the `profile_seed` to adjust `temperature`. You might need to further customize it based on the intended style and characteristics you wish to embed in each unit's responses. For more detailed control, consider using different parameters or even different fine-tuned models if available and appropriate.

Integrating this setup will allow your units to leverage the actual computational power of GPT for generating responses, making your system interactions much more dynamic and intelligent.
